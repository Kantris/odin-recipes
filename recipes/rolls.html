    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is how you make some yummy ass sweet potato rolls your granny used to make before she kicked it. God bless.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 oz. package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canned sweet potato puree</li>
        <li>1/2 cup  warm water (45 C)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp margarine, softened</li>
        <li>1 tsp  salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast, warm water, and 1 tablespoon sugar in a mixing bowl. Let stand 5 minutes.            
        </li>
        <li>Add remaining sugar, sweet potato, butter or margarine, salt, and slightly beaten eggs. Stir to mix well. Stir in 3 cups of flour. Turn out on a lightly floured surface. Knead 2 to 3 minutes, adding just enough of remaining flour to prevent sticking. Do not knead too heavily; when smooth, shape into a ball. Place in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat the surface. Cover, and let raise about 1 hour or longer.
        </li>
        <li>Punch down, and allow dough to rest for 2 minutes. Divide into 16 to 20 balls, and place on a greased cookie sheet or in a 9x13 inch pan. Allow to rise until doubled.
        </li>
        <li>Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 to 20 minutes. Serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
